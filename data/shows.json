      "longDescription": "Sexy Beasts took the 'love is blind' concept literally by having daters wear elaborate creature prosthetics during dates. Originally a British format that aired on BBC Three in 2014, Netflix revived the concept with American and international contestants. From devils to pandas to aliens, the wild costumes became the show's signature, creating some of the most visually memorable moments in dating TV history. The prosthetics take 3-5 hours to apply and were created by award-winning makeup artists.",
